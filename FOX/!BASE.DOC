    What are the RunBase Utilities?
    ================================================================
    RunBase consists of 6 handy command line utilities for all dBase
    III, Clipper, and FoxPro programmers.  All of the RunBase
    utilities are small, fast, support redirection, and full path
    expansion.

    !APPEND:  Super Sonic Append SDF.  This utility appends records
              10x faster than the APPEND SDF command in FoxPro or
              Clipper.

    !COMP  :  A structure comparison utility.  It compares the
              file structure of any two DBF files, and flags the
              differences.

    !DIR   :  Directory of DBF files.  This utility displays the
              number of records in each database.

    !INDEX :  Directory of INDEX files.  This utility displays the
              index expression of NDX and NTX files.

    !STRUCT:  Displays the structure of DBF files.  The structure
              utility has 3 optional parameters for Clipper
              programmers:

              -a  Create database structure arrays for use with
                  DBCREATE()

              -f  Create field name declarations

              -n  Create field number define statements for use in
                  header files

    !ZAP   :  dBase file zapping utility.  Allows files to be
              quickly cut down in size.  It has a couple of
              optional parameters:

              -Sn Save first <n> records and zap the rest

              -Y  Yes, automatically bypass the safety prompt and
                  zap

    ================================================================
    I am a professional programmer located in Tustin California,
    specializing in developing business applications in Clipper and
    C++.

    I wrote the RunBase utilities because there aren't very many
    good utilities to available for use with dBase files.  I made
    the RunBase utilities free and kept its size small, so that you
    can easily and legally install a copy of these handy utilities
    on your clients hard disk.

    While the RunBase utilities are free, I do appreciate hearing
    about them from the users.  If you have comments, suggestions,
    or are interested in my other products; please contact me.
