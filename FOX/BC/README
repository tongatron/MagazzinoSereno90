dBARCODE Version 1.43 Notes

Provided with dBARCODE are two sample programs, DEMO.PRG and BARPRINT.PRG.
Examples of all the capablities of dBARCODE are found in DEMO.PRG.

The LINES values is the total movement of the printer in sixths of an inch.
When two barcodes are printed one above the other, this is the distance
from the top of the first bar code to the top of the second bar code.
When printing on 1 inch labels, the LINES value should be set
to 6 ( 6 * 1/6" = 1" ).

                                              ______
                  ÝÞÞÝÛÞÞÝÝÛ ÝÝÝÞÝÛÞÞÞ ÝÛÞÝÝ        |
                                                    |---- LINES value
                                              ______|     in 1/6 of an inch
                  ÝÞÞÝÛÞÞÝÝÛ ÝÝÝÞÝÛÞÞÞ ÝÛÞÝÝ


Please also note that to print multi-column bar codes with direct calls
to dBARCODE, the bar codes are sent together as one string.  The FORMAT
character is the number of digits in each bar code.

   CALL dBARCODE WITH "0330201220\OCTNOVDEC"
                        ³³
                        ³³
              FORMATÄÄÄÄÙÀÄÄÄÄLINES

In this example the FORMAT is 3, so dBARCODE will print as many 3 digit
bar codes as the string allows.  This call will print 3 bar codes, each 3
digits long, OCT, NOV and DEC.  Important values to know here also are
MARGIN and SPACER.

Page 8:
          CALL dBARCODE with STRING

          Where: STRING = SPECS + "\" + CODE + "\" + DESCR

     ( the second + is missing in the manual )


Page 19:
          STRING = SPECS + "\" + CODE + "\" + DESCR
          CALL dBARCODE with STRING

      ( the third + is missing in the manual )
